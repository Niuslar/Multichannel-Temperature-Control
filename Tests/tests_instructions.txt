Running tests for the Temperature Controller
The stm32_test.py file will contain all the tests we want to run.
This tests assume the Pi is running and the Nucleo-64 is connected correctly. 
I put a copy of the file in ~/Documents/actions-runner/
 
Each test is a function definition with the word 'test' in the name. 

In the .py file there are two lists  of commands to test with their respective expected answer. 
One for the JSON parser and another for the string parser. 
Example: >temperature(25) : COMMAND_OK
You can add/remove commands to test there. 

The test checks the last line received from the MCU via UART. If this matches 
the expected answer, the check passes. 

To run the tests, simply go to where the stm32_test.py file is located and run pytest.
Example:
pi@raspberry: ~/Documents/actions-runner$ pytest
